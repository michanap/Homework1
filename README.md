# TITLE THE LAYAWAY OF THE FUTURE

## Overview and Origin
The Lending domain is among the fastest growing and innovative areas in Fintech.  However, it is not too often we find a company that takes a decades old idea and give it a fresh spin.  We will be getting a new look at the buy now pay later (BNPL) industry and why it is an attractive tool that retailers are using to lure in millenials.

* Name of company  AFTERPAY

* When was the company incorporated?  
Afterpay launched in October 2014 in New Zealand and went public in 2016. In June 2017 it merged with Touchcorp forming Afterpay Touch Group Limited.

* Who are the founders of the company? 
Nick Molnar, who began his career on ebay selling jewelry, and Anthony Eisen the former chief investment officer Guinness Peat Group.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
In 2014 after the financial crisis, Molnar noticed a shift in millenial spending. These consumers preferred the use of debit rather than credit. He identified an opportunity to create a company that would cater to this shift by offering consumers an alternative to credit.  This simple model is to charge retailers a fee in order to offer their customers  interest free instalment plans to pay off their purchase. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  
Afterpay receives 75% of its revenue from charging 4-6% fee to retailers on each transaction completed with consumers using this service.  The remainder of its revenue comes from an 8% late fee charged directly yo the end user if they are to miss an installment payment. Since this service is free to the end user, afterpay's aim is to retrieve all of it's revenue from retailers.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
The company is aiming to disrupt the Lending domain by introducing millinial consumers to the 'Buy now pay later' industry with the use of interest free loans for their purchases. The founder has proven that millenials have a total aversion to credit and are looking to avoid compounding debt. Afterpay's simple 4 installment payments solves the consumers problem by allowing them to complete these larger purchase without the use of credit.
 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended consumers for Afterpay are 18 - 33 year old young adults who either have not yet built a credit history or are simply credit-averse. The sheer market size of the millenials is 75.5MM representating the major force in consumer buying power.  Millenial women, holding the largest sepnding power of any generation, contributes 85% of the US spending.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The advantage that afterpay has over it's competitors is that it offers interest free loans to consumers with no credit check and no interest.  The payment model is simple, 4 installments automatically withdrawn from your account every 2 weeks until your loan is paid off.  Best of all, you receive the items right away.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Afterpay uses two key components for it's technology platform: The Transaction Integrity Engine and the Afterpay Operating Platform.
The Transaction Integrity Engine conducts fraud and repayment capability assesment in real time of its end users. This allows Afterpay to make a real time decision on wether it will provide it's installment services to the consumer. Afterpay uses hundreds of data points on it's underwriting model.  One being it's payment history collected over time to measure credit worthiness, it avoids trending product purchases to protect from fraudulent transactions. Therfore, rejecting 20% of proposed transactions.
The Operating Platform was built by Touchcorp and processes all of it's transactions with the highest level of security under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 
Afterpay is in the Lending domain but in a unique niche of buy now and pay later (BNPL) companies offering small interest free loans to consumers.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
Over the past 5-10 years the traditional lenders in this domain have are seeing new companies challenging the way business is done.  Companies like Kabbage is disrupting the business loan space and even larger companies such as Apple are jumping into the lending space with their new Apple credit card. Although this domain has seen a lot of transition, it has a lot more new companies entering the sector. New companies are thinking about more efficient ways to underwrite loans and review credit history with the use of algorythms to make a quick and informed decision.  

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Ondeck, Lending Club, Affirm, Klarna, Splitit, Sezzle, Zippay


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Afterpay has been able to have a major impact on the Lending domain by reintroducing the buy now pay later industry to Millenials. As a leader in the industry, afterpay provides an alternative to the traditional use of credit on purchases for young adults.  Retailers who offer afterpay to their consumers have seen a 20-50% increase in consumer spending making this just as profitable to retailers.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, 
based on these metrics?
The metrics commonly used for this domain is repayment, the percentage of debts that are repayed in full.  As of last year 95% of the afterpay customer have paid in full and not received a late fee.  Which shows that the company is performing extremely well in this category. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Afterpay is among the fastest growing 'buy now pay later' providers with its share price increasing a staggering 297% last year.  It is the most popular with over 6,000 retail stores signed up to use their services.  Afterpay also reported revenues of $107.1MM in the first half of 2019, up a whopping 124% from the prior period. In comparison, Zip reported revenue of 34.2MM and Splitit revenue at just 789k.



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
I would advise Afterpay to offer a service where consumers can ellect to report their positive credit history buit up with afterpay over a period of time to the credit bureaus.  This gives young adults an opportunity to start a positive credit history before taking substantial debts.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  
Critcs have often painted afterpay as a scheme targeting vulnerable young women to enter into a viscous cycles of debt.  This can be used as a great opportunity to not only educate these young women on how to manage debt but also give the oppotunity to use their good standing to launch into favorable credit history. Companies like afterpay need to realize that although its consumers are averse to credit they will ultimately need some exposure to credit.  And providing this benefit to it's consumers will only improve the customer relationship in the long run.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
This new service would benefit from blockchain technologies.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
With so much data and payment history needed to be stored to provide this service to it's customers, blockchain would be the best option.  With blockchain all transactions between the customer and Afterpay will be recorded.
